# World of Tanks
I love playing mobile games, espacially if it is a startegy or a multiplayer game. The game that I am hook in now is a hame called World of Tanks.
World of tanks is a online multiplayer game played either in your mobile phone or in your pc. Pick any faction you wish to play at,
ranging from the Americans of the west to Imperial Japan of the east. 

Start as a small yet fast teir 1 light tank,

# Listenin to Music 
I personally love listening to music, especially Sabaton. For their music is based in historcal events, figures and battles that has happned 
in our history. One of my personal favorite song that I listen to is called Ghost division, it talks about Erwin Rommel's 7th panzer(tank) 
divison attack France during World War II. He also took part with the invasion of the Sovit Union during Operation Barbarosa.

# Reading Books

I also love reading books, mostly historical documents, myths, fantasy based stories and comics. I love reading for it helps me relax and calm 
down after a long day at schoool and it is my another form of relaxation for me. The reason why I love reading it's because it takes me to 
another world when ever I read a book, it's like I get to become the main characters and interact with the books side characters.
