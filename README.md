# Listenin to Music 
I personally love listening to music, especially Sabaton. For their music is based in historcal events figures and battles that has happned 
in our history. 

My personal favorite song that I listen to is called Bismark. The song talks about the German battleship named Bismark, named after the councilor 
of Purussia. It was considered one of the greatest battleship during WW2.

# Reading Books

I also love reading books, it takes helps me escape the stresses and takes me into another world. Reading is also another form of relaxation for 
me, it helps me come down when ever I am stress.
